A tiny proxying web server that stands in front of InfluxDB 0.9. It intercepts
requests that were deprecated after version 0.8, and translates them into
modern requests. It proxies all other requests directly.

I had embedded devices sending data in the old format. By running this proxy,
I can continue to receive their data until I can upgrade their firmware to
use InfluxDB's new "Line Format".

WARNING: Not for production use without reviewing this code and modifying
it to suit your needs. I had to hard code a couple column names that
required manual type conversion.

Usage:
 * Put InfluxDB's HTTP server on another port (like 8886)
 * Run this on port 8086

   ex:

       /opt/influx-08-shim -bind ':8086' -server 'localhost:8886'
